# Final Capstone

Title: Austin Awaits

Description: An internal tool for a fictional company that relocates professionals to Austin, Texas. It allows list owner admins to create lists of items that a particular customer needs for their new apartment, and which employees from the indicated department can claim and purchase items from, as well as grant access to employees from other departments to claim and purchase items. For this project we used Microsoft SQL Server, C#, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Vue.js.
